As a user of the company's services, I want to have control over my personal data and understand how it is being used, stored, and protected so that I can trust the company with my personal information. By developing a GDPR-compliant privacy policy and implementing necessary changes, we can ensure that we are transparent about how we collect, use, and protect personal data.  By following Agile methodologies and principles such as Lean and continuous improvement, we can quickly and effectively deliver a privacy policy that meets GDPR requirements.
