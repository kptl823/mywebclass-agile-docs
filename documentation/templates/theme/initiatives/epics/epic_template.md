"Title of the Epic"

Description: Epic is a large body of work that is too big to be completed in a single iteration and needs to be broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces called "user stories."

Goals: To deliver a specific feature or set of features that will provide value to the end-user or customer
        To address a particular business need or opportunity that the product or feature will fulfill.  
        To improve the user experience or usability of the product.
        To optimize or streamline a particular process or workflow within the product.

User Stories: As a developer, I want to be able to automatically compile and build the application whenever changes are pushed to the repository, so that I can focus on writing code and not worry about manual builds.

As a tester, I want to be able to run automated tests on the application during the deployment pipeline, so that I can quickly identify issues and prevent them from reaching production.

As a release manager, I want to be able to deploy the application automatically to staging and production environments, so that I can ensure that the application is always up-to-date and running smoothly.

As a product owner, I want to be able to track the progress of the deployment and testing pipeline, so that I can have visibility into the quality of the application and ensure that it meets the needs of our customers.

As a operations team member, I want to be able to monitor the application's performance and availability in real-time, so that I can quickly identify and address any issues that arise.

As a security engineer, I want to be able to run automated security tests on the application during the deployment pipeline, so that I can ensure that the application is secure and free from vulnerabilities.
      
Dependencies:  External dependencies
               Internal dependencies
               Technical dependencies
               Resource dependencies
               Time dependencies

Risks: Scope creep: This occurs when the scope of the project expands beyond its original boundaries, leading to delays and increased costs.
        Incomplete requirements: This occurs when requirements are not fully understood or documented, leading to misunderstandings and delays.
        Technical challenges: This occurs when the technology required to complete the epic is difficult or unfamiliar, leading to delays and quality issues.
        Resource constraints: This occurs when there are not enough resources available to complete the epic, leading to delays and reduced quality

Estimated Effort: epic refers to a large body of work that cannot be completed within a single iteration or sprint, but it is broken down into smaller, more manageable user stories. The effort required to complete an epic can vary widely, depending on the complexity, scope, and the number of user stories that make it up.

Business Value: Faster time-to-market: Automating deployment and testing processes can significantly reduce the time it takes to release new features or updates to the application, enabling the business to respond more quickly to customer needs and market demands.

Improved product quality: Automated testing can help catch bugs and issues early in the development process, resulting in higher-quality products that are more reliable and perform better.

Increased efficiency and productivity: Automating deployment and testing processes frees up developers and testers from manual tasks, allowing them to focus on more valuable activities such as feature development and bug fixing.

Greater agility and flexibility: Continuous integration and deployment practices enable the business to respond quickly to changes in the market or customer needs, allowing it to stay ahead of the competition and capitalize on new opportunities.

Priority: High Priority level
