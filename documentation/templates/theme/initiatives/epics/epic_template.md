"Title of the Epic"

Description: Epic is a large body of work that is too big to be completed in a single iteration and needs to be broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces called "user stories."

Goals: To deliver a specific feature or set of features that will provide value to the end-user or customer
        To address a particular business need or opportunity that the product or feature will fulfill.  
        To improve the user experience or usability of the product.
        To optimize or streamline a particular process or workflow within the product.

User Stories: Determine the different types of users who will interact with the product or feature being developed. This will help you to create user stories that are specific to each user's needs and expectations.
               Prioritize the user stories based on their business value. This will help you to determine which user stories should be tackled first
               Review and refine the user stories regularly with the product owner or stakeholders to ensure that they are still aligned with the high-level goals of the epic.

Dependencies:  External dependencies
               Internal dependencies
               Technical dependencies
               Resource dependencies
               Time dependencies

Risks: Scope creep: This occurs when the scope of the project expands beyond its original boundaries, leading to delays and increased costs.
        Incomplete requirements: This occurs when requirements are not fully understood or documented, leading to misunderstandings and delays.
        Technical challenges: This occurs when the technology required to complete the epic is difficult or unfamiliar, leading to delays and quality issues.
        Resource constraints: This occurs when there are not enough resources available to complete the epic, leading to delays and reduced quality

Estimated Effort: epic refers to a large body of work that cannot be completed within a single iteration or sprint, but it is broken down into smaller, more manageable user stories. The effort required to complete an epic can vary widely, depending on the complexity, scope, and the number of user stories that make it up.

Business Value: By identifying the specific business value,We need to prioritize it in the product backlog, communicate its value to stakeholders, and measure its impact on the organization's goals and objectives.

Priority: High Priority
