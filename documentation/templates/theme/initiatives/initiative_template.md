In Agile methodology, the initiative plan would be used to define a larger user story or theme that needs to be implemented over multiple sprints. The goals, outcomes, and deliverables would be broken down into smaller, more manageable user stories that can be completed within a single sprint.

The milestones listed in the template would correspond to the end of each sprint, where the team can review progress and adjust the plan as needed. Constraints and risks would also be continuously monitored and addressed throughout the sprints.

The related epic (#1) would correspond to the larger theme or objective that the initiative plan is trying to achieve. This would help the team prioritize work and ensure that each sprint is contributing towards the larger goal.
